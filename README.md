# Blog Pitch
"Blog Pitch" is a blog for the football fans who want to share and update fellow mates with news, controversial drama and form discussions in one platform.
In easier words it is a platform where fans can contribute just by registering. It enables football fans to upload their stories as a post to share with the world.
This project mainly showcases the CRUD operations from a more technical aspect.

## Technologies
I have used Laravel framework for this project and MySql as DBMS, I have also used DBeaver GUI for smoother handling of database. I have used basic html, css, and Bootstrap for both aesthetic and functional aspects. Php has been used to create and support all the dynamic and interactive actions in this project. I have used git to push my project on github.

<sub>(few of the technologies have been later deactivated in the project)</sub>

## Challenges
- It was a bit complicated for me to setup the email function as I wasn't aware of the password generation system of google.

- Implementing restrictions on logged out user to be authenticated before making changes on the category form was a problem which I had trouble fixing.

- Setting up eloquent relationship between the user and a post (dynamic post).

These are the very few challenges which I can remember while writing this, I shall add on later for more clarity.

## Features
- User can register and login. Anyone can view the blog posts without registering but cannot contribute or make any changes.

- An user can create posts with pictures and tag it with a category from the drop-down options and add a description with customizable fonts and sizes with the help of CKeditor.

- Users can hard delete or modify their previous posts along with pictures.

- Logged in users can create, edit and delete categories from category list.

- User and page visitors can search blog posts with related keywords.

- Users can only modify their own posts.

- Visitors and users can get in touch with administrator via the contact form for any problems or remakrs.

## Future Updates
- I would like to add group features.

- I would also like to add like and comment features for users.

- Develop the dashboard further for users to view their activities on the blog.

These are the few additions I would like to make initially.
